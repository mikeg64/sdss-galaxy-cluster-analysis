# sdss-galaxy-cluster-analysis
Data analysis Case study for matlab and python utilising docker and singularity containers

Matlab provides an excellent suite of tools for rapidly constructing applications which you can use to prepare and process data.
In this live script we explore use the following matlab tools to explore a data set gathered from the Sloane digital sky survey.   
Scatter plots
Histogram bin counts
Interactive controls for live scripts
k-means clustering
Manipulating data tables
Using bar graphs

The main purpose of this note is to provide a matlab tutorial. The live script was rapidly developed after testing the (beta) 
jupyter service available on ShARC.  Further work experimented with the singularity container service also available on ShARC.
